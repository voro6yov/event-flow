Message Flow is a first Web framework for building event-driven applications with Python 3.10+.

Asynchronous APIs, which allow servers to push notifications and data directly to the client as soon as available, are becoming increasingly important in modern applications that offer instant feedback and streaming data. Message Flow gives you all the tools needed to implement asynchronous APIs.

## Why use Message Flow

- **Fully-featured**: Supports *pub-sub* and *request-async response* communication patterns.
- **Easy**: Designed to be easy to use and learn. Less time reading docs.
- **Reliable**: Production-ready framework, equipped with automated, interactive documentation.
- **Standards-based**: Based on (and fully compatible with) the open standard [AsyncAPI](https://www.asyncapi.com) and [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org).
